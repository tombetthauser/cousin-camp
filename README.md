# üèïÔ∏è Cousin Bootcamp

A live experiment in personal full-stack software bootcamp research, focused on building experience and confidence with quick development in a variety of stacks and deployment environments. Centered on creating a personal portfolio site featuring technically robust and creative projects. A challenging pace will be set and motivated through regular meetings and critiques of projects and the development process behind them. Meetings will be modeled in the spirit of studio visits and will consist of critical discussion, pair-programming debugging sessions and structured brainstorming sessions for new project / feature development. The bootcamp will last as long as it needs to last with the default assumtion of 3 or 6 months.

## What We Will Do  
- Develop a robust, creative portfolio site  
- Build confidence in rapid development across stacks 
- Maintain a challenging growth-oriented pace  
- Have regular 2-4 hour meetings consisting of critical project discussions, air-programming / debugging sessions as-needed and structured brainstorming sessions for project planning
- Stay in touch continuously for debugging sessions and assistance as-needed

# Project Sequence

## 1. Warm-Up: Front-End Only  
- Build a front-end-only GitHub page as a warm-up 
- Should be JS-heavy (directly or via Canvas, 3JS, D3, etc.) 
- Consider a game, tool, or purely visual project 
- Brainstorm ideas, research libraries, and start building 
- If possible, document the process within the project or create a parallel documentation page 
- Continuously try to ask, "Is this a stable MVP?" and "What‚Äôs the minimum work needed to reach the next stable MVP?"  

## 2. Hello World: Full-Stack Template App  
- Build and deploy a minimal full-stack app using a templating engine
- Design a schema/UI; experiment with free online tools  
- Choose a widely used stack with SQL or noSQL
- Identify a widely used, easy deployment platform  
- Optionally integrate user authentication (custom or library-based)  
- Set up database migrations, backend ORM, and templating locally‚Äîdeploy early  
- Optionally experiment with cumulative migrations after deployment  
- Document progress in a README or separate log  
- Continue identifying stages where the app is or could be close to an MVP state  
- Keep it simple but creative‚Äîthis should have portfolio potential  
- Don't be afraid to start over completely if things start feeling overwhelming, deplyment repition is always worth repeating 
- Deploy early and often  

## 3. FE Frameworks: Modern Full-Stack App #1  
- First fully modern full-stack app using a front-end framework (React, Angular, etc.)  
- Consider keeping the same backend and schema as the templating app and reusing the same deployment platform  
- Optionally, add a React front-end to that existing backend  
- This doesn't necessarily need to be a portfolio app, you are welcome to treat it as an experiment or templating app upgrade  
- Optionally switch stacks and/or deployment platform to create a fully distinct portfolio piece  
- Be creative, consider how it complements your other portfolio projects visually, conceptually and technically  
- Decide if user authentication, media uploads, maps, chat, etc, are needed as these impact schema design  
- React is recommended (largest community/resources) but other frameworks are viable
- Optionally research "Building your own (mini) React" as an exercise before diving fully into React  
- Consider cloning a popular platform with a unique twist to simplify scope and focus on building/deployment  
- If possible create parallel documentation and continue to ask "Is this a stable MVP?" and "What‚Äôs the minimum work needed for the next MVP?"  
- Take your time, don‚Äôt hesitate to restart if things feel out of hand
- Continue to deploy early and often

## 4. Expand Portfolio: More Full-Stack Apps  
- Brainstorm a new app, design a schema/UI, and choose a deployment platform  
- Follow the same process as before, don‚Äôt force complexity or novel technologies if they feel like too much, 1-3 new things is enough, repetition is valuable  
- Similar technical structures can be differentiated by concept creativity and diverse visual design  
- Stay self-critical about MVP stages, document the process if possible, restart as needed, and deploy early/often  
- Continue picking from the project menu at least 1-3 more times to build a portfolio with 2+ full-stack apps using front-end frameworks, 1-2 templating engine apps, and 1-5 front-end-only smaller-scope or non-web projects
